# Car_Dekho_DA
Conducted an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 301 used cars listed on CarDekho, focusing on variables such as manufacturing year, selling price, present price, fuel type, seller type, and ownership history.

Derived key insights including trends in depreciation, car age, and the influence of mileage on selling price.

Identified cars with the highest and lowest depreciation, and visualized relationships using heatmaps and pie charts.

Computed correlations between price, age, and kilometers driven to evaluate factors affecting resale value.

Created new features like depreciation and car age to enhance analysis.

Ensured data quality by handling missing values and analyzing categorical distributions.
